# Basic Bomberman HTML Game

This is a basic implementation of the NES game Bomberman, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

## Further Exploration

- Player death
  - The player should die when it is hit by an explosion from a bomb
- Powerups
  - Add powerups that increase the [bomb size](https://bomberman.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) and the [number of bombs](https://bomberman.fandom.com/wiki/Bomb_Up) the player can place. The powerups should spawn randomly after a soft wall is blown up
- 2nd Player
  - Add a 2nd player to the game in the opposite corner and add additional controls so they can be played by someone else
  
**Important note:** I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
